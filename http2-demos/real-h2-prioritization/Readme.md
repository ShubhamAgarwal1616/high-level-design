# üåê Real-World HTTP/2 Prioritization Demo using nghttp2


# Start HTTP/2 Server
Generate a self-signed cert:

`openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes \
-out server.crt -keyout server.key \
-subj "/CN=localhost"
`

run `h2o -c h2o.conf`


# Test Prioritization with CLI
nghttp -nv https://localhost:8443/big1.bin --weight=2 https://localhost:8443/big2.bin --weight=256




# Key things in your log

### Weights are deprecated

[WARNING]: --weight option has been deprecated.


That‚Äôs because newer nghttp2 (‚â•1.66) follows the new HTTP/2 prioritization model
.
Instead of sending explicit PRIORITY frames with weight, it now uses the priority header (u=3, urgency level) and sometimes i=? (incremental).

Example from your log:

priority: u=3


That‚Äôs the new structured field, not the old weight.

### Your H2O version is old (2.2.6)

recv (stream_id=1) server: h2o/2.2.6


This predates the ‚Äúnew priority scheme‚Äù and only understands RFC7540 PRIORITY frames.
Result: your nghttp is talking ‚Äúurgency/priority header‚Äù but H2O is just ignoring it, so both streams get equal scheduling. That‚Äôs why you see frames arriving evenly:

recv DATA frame ... stream_id=1
recv DATA frame ... stream_id=3
recv DATA frame ... stream_id=1
recv DATA frame ... stream_id=3


‚Üí Round-robin, not weighted.

Negotiated SETTINGS_NO_RFC7540_PRIORITIES=1

send SETTINGS frame ... [SETTINGS_NO_RFC7540_PRIORITIES(0x09):1]


That means nghttp told the server: I don‚Äôt support the old RFC7540 tree-based prioritization.
So H2O never even tries to build a weight tree.


# How to actually demo prioritization

You have two paths:

### Option A: Stay with H2O 2.2.6 (old server)

Build an older nghttp2 client (<1.41) that still supports --weight and real PRIORITY frames.

Then you‚Äôll see uneven delivery (big1.bin drains much faster than big2.bin).

### Option B: Upgrade H2O

Latest H2O (‚â•2.3.0) understands the new priority header (u=?, i=?).

With your nghttp2/1.66, you can run:

nghttp -nv https://localhost:8443/big1.bin --urgency=0 \
https://localhost:8443/big2.bin --urgency=7


‚Üí urgency 0 = highest priority, 7 = lowest.

H2O ‚â•2.3.0 will honor that and you‚Äôll see the high-urgency stream fill first.
